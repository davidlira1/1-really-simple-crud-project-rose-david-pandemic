Hey David and Rose,

Nice effort.  I know this stuff can be difficult, but what you submitted is exactly right.  You are so close to finishing, I'll bet you could knock it out with another hour or two.  From the looks of it, you are chort an update and delete endpoint, and then your DataService, which goes really fast.

Great Job!  I look forward to seeing what you do next week.

Rob
